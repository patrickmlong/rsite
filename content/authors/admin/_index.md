Hi! I'm Patrick. I'm a curiosity-driven data scientist with a background in machine learning, neuroscience and tech transfer. I specialize in applying statistical models to predict and improve healthcare outcomes with particular expertise in ensemble algorithms and imbalanced data methodologies. I hold a PhD in neuroscience where I investigated therapeutic strategies to combat nervous system disease. I have supported machine learning innovations in the commercial and clinical settings in areas such as disease diagnosis, therapy initiation and patient progression.

I'm passionate about combining data with curiosity to make healthcare better for everyone.  

I also enjoy supporting aspiring analytics professionals with their career goals. Feel free to reach out :)
